# Movie Watchlist
Solo Project inspired from Scrima's frontend web developer course

## Start
- Figma design - Design for the movie website - https://www.figma.com/file/jhFRdFIdHpRxsDznNXtpXw/Movie-Watchlist?node-id=2%3A17
- OMDb API - Movie API - https://www.omdbapi.com/

## Requirements
- Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html. 
- Index = search page.  Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results. 
- Button to "add to watchlist" which saves data to local storage.  
- Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage.  

## Additional features
From a glance looking at the design and API I will list any additional features I would like to add while building the page
- Ensure responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop
- When Watchlist button is clicked to change the icon to a heart (or something similar)
